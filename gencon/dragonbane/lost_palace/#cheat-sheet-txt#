Pushing a Roll
If you fail, but not critically, you can push the roll; reroll all dice and gain a condition of your choice

Each stat has an associated condition. If you have a condition marked then all rolls associted with that stat have a Bane.
If you have all 6 conditions and suffer another, lose D6 WP; if you are also out of WP, lose D6 HP.
You can heal one condition during a stretch rest and all conditions during a shift rest.
